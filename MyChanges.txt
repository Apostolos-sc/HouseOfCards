  Other Notes:
  I basically just copied and retrofitted Apostolos' implementation of wikipage.php and search.php to implement the View user and Search User pages.
  If you goto deploy these changes the viewing users should work except for adminsayma, this is because she has a game favourited in the DB that does not exist, this causes an error.
  I beleive all the redirect links should be set to redirect to the goldenagesolutions.com URL.
  I lazily uploaded these just from my computer without using git, hopefully thats not a problem.
