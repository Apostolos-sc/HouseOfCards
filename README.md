# Selenium Test Cases
To run the test cases:
1: Install the selenium ide browser extension and open it.
2: Download the HouseOfCardsTestSuite.side file from this repository
3: Select Open Existing Project In Selenium IDE

NOTE: Some test cases will not work or may not work more than once, this is because some test cases create a new user and if that test was already run then the user already exists and will therefore fail.
